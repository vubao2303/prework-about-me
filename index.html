      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love learning and evolving and challenging myself with different aspects of life. Double majored in Liberal studies and social behavior, what could be more foreign to me than computer science.
      </p>
      <p>Afterbackpacking around 30 countries, I realized that technology and computerscience are taking over the world. Everyone is looking for the newestdevelopments and with them comes the creativeness and valuable tools. I want tobe part of the technology evolution to help shape the world into a more modernand productive environment or at the very least, understand the concept ofthis digital world that the future will soon mostly be built on.
